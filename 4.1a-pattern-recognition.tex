\section {Pattern recognition}
The data carving field, despite being actively studied, does not have the amount of research papers that other fields have. This implies that improvements in current data carving techniques are likely to use knowledge transferred from other areas. While in a machine learning search the excess of relevant papers becomes a problem, an equivalent data carving search may face a scarcity of relevant papers.

But, in order to find a field of study that describes the data carving problem in a more generic manner, the correct terminology must be used. Essentially, data carving could be described as a  ``pattern recognition'' problem, but this term is almost as broad as ``machine learning'', as some of the unsuccessful first search attempts showed. Using ``automatic pattern recognition'' was a slight improvement, but still not precise enough.

The interpretation of the inner structure of a file is usually done by parsers, which uses a representation of that structure to extract or transform the file's content. But bibliography on parsers generally refers to language parsers, dealing with questions not entirely applicable to data carving, which is why the searches using the term ``parser'' were also unsuccessful.

A Wikipedia search was conducted to find a better term to the problem. Several pages related to machine learning were read, in an empirical search for links that could lead to a potential better term. The most useful result was found at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pattern\_recognition \cite{wikipedia_editors_pattern_2018}, giving the following glossary of pattern recognition algorithms:
    classification algorithms,
    clustering algorithms,
    ensemble learning algorithms,
    general algorithms for predicting arbitrarily-structured
    sets of labels,
    multilinear subspace learning algorithms,
    real-valued sequence labeling algorithms,
    regression algorithms, and
    sequence labeling algorithms.

% \begin{itemize}
    Classification algorithms
    are supervised algorithms predicting categorical labels. Clustering algorithms
    are unsupervised algorithms predicting categorical labels.
    Ensemble learning algorithms
    are supervised meta-algorithms for combining multiple learning algorithms together.
    Multilinear subspace learning algorithms
    predict labels of multidimensional data using tensor representations.
    Real-valued sequence labeling algorithms
    predict sequences of real-valued labels.
    Regression algorithms
    predict real-valued labels.
    Sequence labeling algorithms 
    predict sequences of categorical labels.
% \end{itemize}

It is important to notice that different classes of algorithms would be more suitable for different learning objectives.
A clustering algorithm could be used to gather information on a source data with unknown structure.
A classification algorithm could be used to attribute labels to each disk sector, which would then become a data carving solution able to retrieve unfragmented data.
Sequence labeling was the algorithm class selected to be further studied, as it has the potential to organize the given labels and to deal with different levels of granularity, since it may be interesting to label substructures in the data.

Sequence labeling deals with the task of attributing categorical labels to a group of instances where, unlike happens with other classification problems, those instance labels are not independent.
One example of such task is known as Part Of Speech (POS) tagging, where the goal is, given a word in a sentence, classify it, for example as a noun or a verb.
The classification of each word is not independent since it provides context from which the meaning of the word may be inferred.

Another example of a sequence labeling task is found in speech recognition.
The sound of a spoken sentence is split into parts and each part receives a label corresponding to a phoneme. But those labels are not independent since some combinations of phonemes are meaningful while others are not. Thus, taking this context into account increases the accuracy of the results.

From those classes of pattern recognition approaches mentioned above, both classification algorithms and sequence labeling algorithms are good choices.
The difference is that the plain classification method should be easier to implement, while the sequence labeling method is expected to predict the labels better.

Another reason to choose sequence labeling over plain classification is that this approach may lead to developments in information extraction: if the available labels include potential data substructures, recognizing those may be used not only to classify the file but also for retrieving information from it.
