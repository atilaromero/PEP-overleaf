\section{Challenges}

Each of the steps cited by \cite{ali_review_2018} for the data carving process deals with a main challenge. The identification step is responsible for classifying the file type. Validation also deals with classification, but is a complementary step to the previous one to reduce false positives, often using a different technique. Reassembling main challenge is fragmentation.

In the current proposal, a new type of challenge is introduced. Instead of using previous knowledge of the file structure to improve carving results, would be possible to do the inverse and use insights from the carving process to reveal structures in the file?
